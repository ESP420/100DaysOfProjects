                    I’ve been
                    looking to make a transition and
                    have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                    found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                    grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working
                    as
                    a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

                    bootcamp, I’ve
                    never
                    written a line of code. I
                    needed some structure from
                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
                    staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
                    agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way
                    that no
                    tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                    developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                    multiple
                    offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
